Introduction
============
A small OpenRISC 1000 baremetal application to be run on the Allwinner A31 SoC
to gain some information about the AR100 core (an or1k implementation) present
in that SoC.

Usage
=====
The application is intended to be loaded into SRAM from the FEL mode with the
'fel' tool available from https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-tools.

Embedded in the OpenRISC 1000 binary is a small ARM "boot loader",
which is intended to be run first, it's sole purpose is to deassert the
reset line to the AR100 core.

To build the ARM "boot loader":
$ make -C ar100-boot/

To build, load and run the OpenRISC baremetal application:
$ make load

A note about the SRAM and exception vectors
===========================================
AR100 uses an SRAM located at addresses 0x40000 - 0x54000
(as seen from the ARM cores) as instruction and data memory.
The OpenRISC 1000 architecture defines a generous space (0x100 bytes) for each
exception vector i.e.

0x100 vector0
...
0x200 vector1
...
0x300 vector3
...
etc

This is rather memory consuming, especially if you are using an internal
SRAM as the main memory.
To avoid this, the Allwinner engineers have added address decode logic to
the lower addresses of the SRAM, so that only the first word of each 0x100
multiple is actually routed to the memory.
The second word of each 0x100 multiple reads out as 0x15000000 = l.nop and the
rest as 0x00000000.
i.e. all exception vectors have to be implemented like this:

l.j exception_handler
 l.nop

The actual contiguous SRAM memory starts at address 0x44000.
